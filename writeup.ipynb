    "# Model Predictive Control Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to design a model predictive controller(MPC) to drive a vehicle in the simulator. MPC controller is an optimal controller and it is different from a PID controller. A PID controller calculates the acutator commands based on the propotional, integral and derivative operations of the error signal. Whereas a MPC controller predicts the system outputs for a finite number of steps in future and calculates the acutator commands by minimizing a cost function (function of error, usage of actuator etc.). MPC algorithm takes into account the actuator contrains and time delays.With mpc it is possible to acheive higher system performance solve more complex problems. The disadvantages of MPC are high computation intensive and it is harder to define the stability of the system with MPC.\n",

    "There are two ways to describe the lateral dynamics of a car such as kinematic models, dynamic models. The kinematic models consider only the geometry of the vehicle motion and the car to decribe the behavior. It is simple, less computation intensive and has lesser accuracy compared to dynamic model. The dynamic models considers not only the geometry but also the forces acting on the vehicle to describe the vehicle motion. In this project only a non-linear kinematic model is used to describe the motion of the vehicle. Kinematic model is used because it is less computation intensive and it is has sufficient accuracy to describe the motion of a car in the simulator.The bicycle motion model discussed in the lecture is used in the project. The following picture shows the bicycle model of a car.\n",

The simlulator gives the reference points to the program which are the point lying in the centre of the road on the track. These reference points are used to fit a curve forming a reference trajectory. The error $cte_t$ is the minimum distance between the reference trajectory and the current location of the car.

Where N is the prediction horizon the number of steps in the future which the MPC controller optimizes. The sample time $dt$ is the sample time the MPC uses in the model to perform the integration and the derivation in the model prediction. It has to be noted that this sample time of the model is different from the from the sample time of the controller. The cycle time of the controller is usually determined by the specification of the micro-controller, sensors and actuators used in the system. The sample time discussed here is only the sampling time used by the MPC to predict the states of the system using the discrete time state space model used to describe the behavior of the system. Both of the parameters sample time $dt$ and the prediction horizon N has a huge influence in the performance of the MPC controller and so they have to be chosen carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling time $dt$ determines the accuracy of the model as it detmines the accuracy of the integrative and derivative operations used the model. For the model to be accurate the sampling time $dt$ has to be as small as possible. But reducing the sampling time reduces the total time in future the MPC optimizes. The product of sampling time and the prediction horizon determines the total time ($t = dt*N$) in future in which the system response is optimized by the MPC. Increasing the prediction horizon increases the total time optimized by MPC but increasing the N increases the computation effort of the controller as N determines the size of the optimizers solution. Therefore chosing the sample time and the prediction horizon N is a trade off between the performance and feasibility( limited by computation effort).\n",

    "## Adapting the MPC for time delay\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real car there is always a finite delay between the actuator command and the actuation. This happens due to the latency of the signal transmission and the dynamics of the actuator. This can be explicitly adapted in the MPC controller. The time delay is simulated in this project by delaying the message to the simulator.There are two ways to adapt the MPC for latency either by calculating the system state for the period of time delay using the model before the signal being sent to the MPC controller or by modeling the time delay in the model used by MPC. In this implementation the a time delay of 100 ms is modeled in the MPC optimizer where the actuator command is delayed for one sample (as $dt = 0.1 s$). Since the delay is modeled in the optimizer it takes care of it acutomatically. Compared to the system without delay the system with time delay of 100 ms required 2 more samples in the prediction horizon to acheive comparable performance. The approach of simulating the system state for a period of time delay was not working because the model used is not very accurate.\n"
